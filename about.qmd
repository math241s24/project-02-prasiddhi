This project was developed by Prasiddhi Thapaliya (@prasiddth) for [MATH/STAT241](https://aallorant.github.io/math241s24/) at Reed College. The project uses data from a coffee reviews dataset from GitHub user @jldbc to compare coffee flavor traits by country of origin.

When viewing the R files, open the project file first (project-02.Rproj). This will allow all data from .csv files to be imported without needing to change file pathways.
